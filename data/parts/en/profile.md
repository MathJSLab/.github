The **MathJSLab Organization** was created to bring together the [MathJSLab Project](https://mathjslab.com/) [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/MathJSLab/repositories).

This organization owns:
- The [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mathjslab) [repository](https://github.com/MathJSLab/mathjslab).
- The [demo web application](https://app.mathjslab.com) [repository](https://github.com/MathJSLab/mathjslab-app).
- The [project page](https://mathjslab.com) [repository](https://github.com/MathJSLab/mathjslab-www).

All relevant actions of this organization are recorded in our [logbook](../LOGBOOK.md).

The overall design guidelines for the project, the roadmap for next steps, research, and other relevant information are stored in the [`roadmap`](https://github.com/MathJSLab/.github/tree/main/roadmap) directory.

To clone all of the [organization's repositories](https://github.com/orgs/MathJSLab/repositories) locally, create a directory called `mathjslab-repositories` and save the file [`mathjslab.package.json`](https://github.com/MathJSLab/.github/blob/main/data/mathjslab.package.json) in it with the name `package.json`. The scripts in this file clone all of the [**MathJSLab Organization**'s repositories](https://github.com/orgs/MathJSLab/repositories), creating a complete workspace locally. This file also contains additional build scripts for the individual projects.
